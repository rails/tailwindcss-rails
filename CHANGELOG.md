## v4.0.0 / 2025-02-01

### Upgrade to Tailwind CSS v4

General changes:

- The dependency on `tailwindcss-ruby` is set to `~> 4.0`.
- The location of (optional) `postcss.config.js` has moved from the `config/` directory to the app root.
- The input file `app/assets/tailwind/application.tailwind.css` has been renamed to `app/assets/tailwind/application.css`.
- If Propshaft is being used, `app/assets/tailwind` will be excluded from its asset handling.
- The Inter font is no longer packaged with the gem.
- Some Tailwind class names in the generated ERB templates are updated for v4.
- The README is updated to contain verbose instructions on upgrading.

Changes to the `tailwindcss:install` task:

- The `tailwindcss:install` task no longer installs `config/tailwind.config.js`, as v4 recommends placing Tailwind configuration in the CSS file.
- The Inter font is no longer configured in the application layout.
- The "tailwind" stylesheet link tag will only be added to the application layout if Propshaft isn't in use and therefore already handling `app/assets/build/tailwind.css`. Previously it was always injected, resulting in the tag being rendered twice if Propshaft was in use.

New task `tailwindcss:upgrade` upgrades many apps cleanly:

- Cleans up `config/tailwind.config.js` and references it from the CSS file as recommended for v4 upgrades.
- Runs the upstream upgrader (note: requires `npx` to run the one-time upgrade, but highly recommended).
- Removes configuration for the Inter font from the application layout.
- If present, moves `config/postcss.config.js` to the root directory.
- The "tailwind" stylesheet link tag will be removed if Propshaft is in use and already handling `app/assets/build/tailwind.css`.
- The input file `app/assets/tailwind/application.tailwind.css` will be moved to `app/assets/tailwind/application.css`.

Thanks to @EricGusmao, @patriciomacadden, @excid3, and @brunoprietog for their feedback, contributions, and advice on v4 support.

### Other changes

- The gem's Rails generators are now hidden in the `rails g --help` output. #483 @patriciomacadden

## v3.3.1 / 2025-01-23

* Pin the dependency on `tailwindcss-ruby` to `~> 3.0` to prevent users from upgrading Tailwind while still on v3 of this gem.

  While it was useful during the Tailwind v4 beta period to allow users to float this dependency to try upgrading, we know (now that v4.0.0.rc1 of this gem is out) that not everything will work well if combining Tailwind v4 with `tailwindcss-rails` v3. Pinning this dependency should protect developers against unexpected issues.


## v3.3.0 / 2025-01-19

* Add support for using the puma plugin in a standalone puma process (outside of `rails server`). (#458) @flavorjones


## v3.2.0 / 2025-01-10

* Improve the scaffold views by making positions, padding, and sizes more consistent, add titles to all pages, add hover states and semantic colors to buttons and links, and change border and focus colors on fields with errors. (#452) @patriciomacadden


## v3.1.0 / 2024-12-29

### Notable changes

The tailwindcss plugins "form", "typography", and "container-queries" have been dropped from the default generated `tailwind.config.js` file. If you'd like to use them, you can re-add them to your project by uncommenting the appropriate lines in your config file. (#446) @flavorjones


## v3.0.0 / 2024-10-15

### Notable changes

* The upstream `tailwindcss` executable has been extracted from this gem into a new dependency, `tailwindcss-ruby`. @flavorjones

  In advance of the upcoming TailwindCSS v4 release, we are decoupling the `tailwindcss` executable from the Rails integration. This will allow users to upgrade TailwindCSS at a time of their choosing, and allow early adopters to start using the beta releases.

## v2.0.0 / 2021-12-18

Tailwind CSS for Rails now uses [the standalone executables made for Tailwind 3](https://tailwindcss.com/blog/standalone-cli). These executables are platform specific, so there's actually separate underlying gems per platform, but the correct gem will automatically be picked for your platform. Supported platforms are Linux x64, macOS arm64, macOS x64, and Windows x64. (Note that due to this setup, you must install the actual gems – you can't pin your gem to the github repo.)

This is a completely different approach from previous versions of tailwindcss-rails. Gone is Ruby-powered purger. Everything now works as it would if you had installed the Node version of Tailwind. But without the Node!

This setup requires a separate watch process to run, which is configured and modeled after the approach used in [cssbundling-rails](https://github.com/rails/cssbundling-rails). Look at the README for more details.

Huge thanks to [@flavorjones](https://github.com/flavorjones) for creating the platform-specific gem setup 🙏


## v1.0.0 / 2021-12-14

Nothing. But we're promote 0.5.4 to 1.0.0 to go along with the final release of Rails 7.0. Because as a new sanctioned default option of Rails 7, we should stick to the API, and this communicates that 🚀🥳


## v0.5.4 / 2021-12-03

* Only depends on the `railties` gem.


## v0.5.3 / 2021-12-03

* Match button label for destroy with text used by regular Rails templates by [@dhh](https://github.com/dhh)
