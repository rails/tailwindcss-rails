## v2.0.0 / 2021-12-18

Tailwind CSS for Rails now uses [the standalone executables made for Tailwind 3](https://tailwindcss.com/blog/standalone-cli). These executables are platform specific, so there's actually separate underlying gems per platform, but the correct gem will automatically be picked for your platform. Supported platforms are Linux x64, macOS arm64, macOS x64, and Windows x64. (Note that due to this setup, you must install the actual gems ‚Äì you can't pin your gem to the github repo.)

This is a completely different approach from previous versions of tailwindcss-rails. Gone is Ruby-powered purger. Everything now works as it would if you had installed the Node version of Tailwind. But without the Node!

This setup requires a separate watch process to run, which is configured and modeled after the approach used in [cssbundling-rails](https://github.com/rails/cssbundling-rails). Look at the README for more details.

Huge thanks to [@flavorjones](https://github.com/flavorjones) for creating the platform-specific gem setup üôè
